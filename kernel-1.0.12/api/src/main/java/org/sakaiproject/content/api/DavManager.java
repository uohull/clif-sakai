    /* 
     * TODO: Locks
     * General question on locks:
	 * DAV has a locking scheme. Currently it is implemented entirely within DavServlet.
	 * Since Sakai also has locking, we end up with two locking systems that
	 * don't talk. If we do things like copying collections in Content, it also
	 * makes it nearly impossible to do what the protocol suggests and copy
	 * all but the locked items, returning a list of what was and was not
	 * copied. At the moment we simply give an error for the whole operation.
	 * I believe that is legal. I am also skeptical about the ability of clients
	 * to cope with partial success. However to produce a maximally compliant DAV,
	 * we would probably need to move DAV locking into Content.
	 * (hedrick at rutgers dot edu)
	 */

    /* 
     * General comment on error handling:
	 * DAV has the possibility to return an XML structure listing items and error codes. 
	 * If an operation on a collection fails for some items in the collection, the spec requires
	 * us to return a list of all items indicating where it succeeded and where it failed.
	 * Operations here must either succeed in their entirety, fail and back out of all 
	 * changes, or return a list of items and status. It would clearly be easier not to
	 * return such a list. If that is the intent, care must be taken to avoid partial
	 * failure. E.g. in copying collections where an existing one will be deleted, it
	 * would be prudent to copy to a new name, verify that the copy worked, and then
	 * delete the old one and rename the new one.
	 * (hedrick at rutgers dot edu)
	 */

    /* 
     * General comment on return values:
	 * These operations all return boolean. The reason is that DAV has two different
	 * success codes: 201 Created and 204 No content. We must distinguish between
	 * cases where new content was created and where it was not. E.g. the spec for
	 * copy says that 201 is returned if a new resource is created, while
	 * 204 is returned if the resource existed. Operations are expected to
	 * return true for Created and false for No Content. Some operations will
	 * always return the same value. This is noted in the descriptions.
	 * At the HTTP level, 201 returns a URI for the new resources. This allows for
	 * the possibility that we could use a different name than the requested one.
	 * If we wanted to do that, then these functions would return null or a
	 * String. However because clients will typically use these functions to
	 * model a Unix file system, I strongly recommend against doing this.
	 * (hedrick at rutgers dot edu)
	 * 
	 * Maybe the return value should be a List of id's indicating entities for which 
	 * the operation succeeded/failed?  Or a Map (hashtable) with keys for each
	 * item involved in the operation and values indicating whether the operation
	 * succeeded or failed?
	 * (jimeng at umich dot edu)
	 * 
	 * Sure, if you want to do that. it would map nicely into what DAV is supposed to 
	 * return. Note that the DAV protocol requires minimization  of exceptions. So if 
	 * a whole tree fails in the same way, you mention  only the top of the tree. While 
	 * it isn't clear in the text, it  appears that if there is partial success, you 
	 * return a multistatus  XML structure that lists only the things that failed. And 
	 * for them  you list only the top of any tree for which all elements failed with  
	 * the same error code.
	 * 
	 * As I read it, most operations return either 201 or 204. I believe the  only ones 
	 * where partial success is possible are ones where a whole  tree is manipulated at 
	 * once.
	 * 
	 * Copy certainly has this issue, since one could run into a lock or a  quota problem 
	 * during the recursive copy.
	 * 
	 * Delete can succeed partially if elements are locked. Whether other  types of 
	 * failure are possible depends upon the implementation. I'm  guessing that a failure 
	 * to delete an item other than because of a  lock would indicate a serious problem 
	 * with the db or file system.
	 * 
	 * Move can have partial success due to system failures. Is anything  else possible? 
	 * I'm not so sure. If overwrite is on, the implied  delete could partially fail, 
	 * but in that case the move can't occur at  all, so optimally you'd not do the delete 
	 * and fail the whole operation. In theory if you're copying to a different file 
	 * system you  could get a quota problem, but in Sakai I suspect quotas are on a  
	 * sakai-wide basis so that wouldn't happen.
	 * 
	 * Lock can have partial success, but I'm not currently dealing with the  details of 
	 * locking unless you tell me you're sure you can implement  DAV compatibility. 
	 * Otherwise I'd rather maintain the locks myself,  and checking for locks before 
	 * calling you.
